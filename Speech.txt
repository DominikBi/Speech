Nelson Mandela

“It always seems impossible until it's done.” 
He was called father by his nation.
He has revolutionized south africa, has been president for 5 years and fought against discrimination agains blacks.


Nelson Mandela was born on a farm and had a indescrible amount of motivation.
I hope everyone understands how incredible difficult it is to keep up even under this circumstances.
His hard work and protest has paid off at the end. He is an example for every revoultionary.
He began his life herding sheep  on a farm in south afrikas eastern cape.
As he grew older he studied at the fort hare university, because of his best possible education for a black.
There he already started to protest with other students for harmony and equality.
Nelson Mandela organised a plan for a free and democratic south africa, in which all races would be treated equally.
But then at the meeting he was banned by the goverment from attending.
In 1962, as he was 45 years old, He was captured and sentenced to prison for 5 years.
Even in prison his motivation did not leave and his moral leadership and stature continued to grow.
Then at the age of 71 Mandela was finally released. 
At the age of 75 he became the countries first black president.
He revoke numerous laws of apartheit during his reign.
He also invested a lot in medical care for all races.
He then became an icon of leadership and humanity.

Nelson Mandela is the reason why south africa has a future, he is the reason why black people all over the world have a future. The world needs revolunists like mandela.
